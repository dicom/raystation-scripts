# RAYSTATION-SCRIPTS

This contains a collection of scripts which are used in our clinic to improve
workflow with the radiotherapy treatment planning system RayStation.

The scripts are written in Python and can be executed inside RayStation by
using the built-in scripting workspace.

The scripts are currently compatible with RayStation 12A and are used with Python 3.6.

Graphical user interfaces (GUI) use the Tkinter package.

## Contents

All executable scripts are found in the root folder.

Sub-folders contain libraries & resources used by the root folder scripts.
