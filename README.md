# RAYSTATION-SCRIPTS

This project contains a collection of scripts which are used in our clinic to improve
workflow within the radiotherapy treatment planning system RayStation.

The scripts are written in Python and can be executed inside RayStation by
using the built-in scripting workspace.

The scripts are currently used with RayStation 12A and Python 3.6 in our clinic.

Graphical user interfaces (GUI) use the Tkinter package, and communication with
the Mosaiq database is handled with the pymssql interface.

## Contents

All executable scripts are found in the root folder.

Sub-folders contain libraries & resources used by the root folder scripts.
